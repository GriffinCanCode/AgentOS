/*!
 * Intelligent Shard Configuration
 *
 * CPU-topology-aware shard count calculation for concurrent data structures.
 * Computes optimal shard counts based on hardware topology, ensuring efficient
 * scaling from embedded devices (1-4 cores) to high-end servers (128+ cores).
 *
 * # Design: Pure Functions Over Singleton
 *
 * Instead of OnceLock singleton (unnecessary overhead), we use pure functions
 * with `#[inline]` for zero-cost abstraction. The compiler can:
 * - Constant-fold CPU count checks at compile time in many cases
 * - Inline all calculations into call sites
 * - Eliminate redundant calls via CSE (Common Subexpression Elimination)
 *
 * Result: **Faster, simpler, better inlining** than singleton pattern.
 *
 * # Design Rationale
 *
 * - **Power-of-2 shards**: Enable fast modulo via bitwise AND (x & (n-1))
 * - **CPU-proportional scaling**: More cores = more beneficial parallelism
 * - **Contention multipliers**: Based on empirical access patterns
 * - **Compile-time optimization**: Pure functions inline better than singletons
